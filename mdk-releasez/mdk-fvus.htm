  Notes		-  I got this ISO from a source on the internet. It took me a couple of hours to get it,
			but it was worth it. This game it's one of the most rare games of PS2.
			So I managed to repack the game has a release
			and share it in the WWW. It's faster and easier to get this way.
			I burned this ISO with ImgBurn v2.4.2.0 to test out. Worked great.
			So I advise you to burn this ISO with ImgBurn too.

  Comments      -  Here it is. One of the most rare PS2 games. FantaVision, american version.
			I also mentioned in the EUR release that the american and japanese OST
			versions of the game sucks. Well, the american is not that bad. Enjoy.
