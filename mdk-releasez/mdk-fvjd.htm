  Notes		-  I got this ISO from a source on the internet.
			This game it's one of the most rare games of PS2.
			So I managed to repack the game has a release and share it in the WWW.
			It's faster and easier to get this way. This is a DEMO version of the
			only FantaVision that's on CD. All the later versions are on DVD-ROM.
			I burned this ISO with ImgBurn v2.4.2.0 to test out. Worked great.
			So I advise you to burn this ISO with ImgBurn too.

  Comments      -  Here it is. One of the most rare PS2 games. FantaVision, Japanese Trial Version.
			First seen on the Playstation Festival 2000.
			The FIRST version. The VERY FIRST FantaVision.
			Even firster than the first. Enjoy.
