    <br>
    It's been around 2 years since I last updated the site. About time to update this a little and fix a few things that got messed up. So, for starters, some of the stuff is still 
	unavailable, but I'll be uploading the missing downloads in the next days (hopefully). 
	I'll update the pages once the files are back online. Also changed the 
	banner images. Aside that, mostly everything is the same site-wide.<br>
	<br>
	I hope everyone is still enjoying playing Daytona USA 2 on Supermodel 
	emulator. A little tip: Use the keys 5 and 6 to enter the configuration menu 
	of the &quot;arcade&quot;, and change the settings to &quot;100 Miles&quot; or similar. Then, 
	when selecting AT or MT after selecting the car, keep pressing START to 
	enter in Time Lap Mode. Using Time Lap Mode in a &quot;100 Miles&quot; or similar mode, 
	will let you navigate the track without opponents and without timer, a sort 
	of <b>free roaming</b> around the tracks. Use this method to explore, view 
	and discover the tracks of the game like never before. But be aware: you 
	cannot go Reverse. The game won't let you. XD<br>
	<br>

	online.</b></div>

    	First update of the year. =)<br>
	Nothing added. There's not really any news to post. Just posting to show 
	that the site is still alive.<br>
	Has everyone been playing Daytona USA 2 using <b>Supermodel 3</b>? Indeed, 
	this emulator is one of the best out there. If you're having some problems 
	with the 0.2a version of the emulator, grab the <b>0.3a WIP</b> version on 
	the main boards of the emulator and you'll see right from the start a big 
	difference in the performance of the game and emulator. I also advice to use 
	the <b>Supermodel UI GUI/FrontEnd</b> with the emulator to make everything 
	easier.<br>
	That's all for now!<br></div>

    Latelly, some of the links on the website had been offline due to a 4shared 
	hosting problem. That is now <b>FIXED</b>. =D So everything is now again 
	available to download. Sorry for taking so lonk to fix the issue. Also in 
	the process, I detected some other errors and bad-links, so they're fixed 
	now. =)<br>
	Hope you all have been signing the petition and visiting the forum! Let's 
	bring the game home!<br>
	For now, that's all! With luck, the next update will be the news of the game 
	announced to consoles! (thumbs up)<br>
	<br>
	<span style="font-size: 6pt">P.S.: The links to the ROM files of the game 
	and the Daytona 2K1 release will remain offline until further notice. They 
	may even never be available for download again. This is to avoid any legal 
	problems with SEGA, and since we want the game on console systems and have a 
	petition to it, it would be bad to keep sharing those files.</span><br></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    	So here I am again, after some months without updating. =) No new stuff 
	to add, until now!<br>
	<br>
	First, I fixed a little something on the website. Some wrong information was 
	posted in the Music and Sound section. Thanks to our fan <b>Sestren NK</b>, 
	the info was corrected and removed. It turns out that the <b>supposed DDR 
	version of Skyscrapper Sequence wasn't official</b>. The DDR version that 
	was posted here was infact a <b>StepMania MP3 file created by no other than 
	Sestren NK himself</b>. Years ago, when I grabbed the MP3 file, I really 
	though that was a DDR official song, but instead, Sestren NK was making some 
	songs to StepMania and I happened to download that, don't remember from 
	where. Anyway, Sestren NK sent me an e-mail and explained to me the whole 
	thing and was also kind enough to send me the files to post them here in the 
	website. =) So now you can&nbsp; play his music in <b>StepMania</b>! You'll 
	find all the needed info in the section.<br>
	I also noticed that the booklet link of the OST was broken, fixed that.<br>
	<br>
	We now have our own <b>Forum</b>! Feel free to visit, register and post 
	there. Share your Daytona USA 2 best times, machine locations, how much you 
	already spent in a machine, talk about the SuperModel3 emulator, and more! 
	The link is in the Main menu.<br>
	<br>
	Also, I took the liberty of creating <b>a petition for SEGA to bring Daytona 
	USA 2 (and other Model 3 games) to Home systems (XBLA and PSN)</b>. Everyone 
	interested in having the game, should sign the petition, don't worry, it's 
	free! =D Help us bringing Daytona USA 2 to play at home! The link to the 
	petition is in the Main menu.<br>
	<br>
	New added to the downloads section, is <b>Daytona 2K1</b>. It's a project I 
	created some years ago, feel free to visit the page, read what's in it, and 
	download the game. =D<br>
	<br>
	Also changed the favicon of the website to something better. Maybe some more 
	changes in the future. For now, that's all Daytona USA 2 fans, and I hope 
	the website keeps bringing good stuff for everyone!<br></div>

    @ Monday, 12 March 2012
    <br>
    <br>
    So here's the first (and probably only) update of 2012. It would be cool if SEGA released the game for New-Gen consoles. That would be motiv for update. XD
    But of course, this isn't the reason why I'm posting, right? =)<br>
	I've been into <b><a target="_blank" href="http://ultrastardx.sourceforge.net/">UltraStar Deluxe</a></b> for some years now. For those who don't know, this is like SingStar for PC.
    You sing! =) And over the months, I started creating my own songs for the game. Of course, 4 of those songs are from Daytona USA 2. =P<br>
	Until now, only 1 of those songs had been available for download. You could 
	(and still can) get it from <b>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://mdk-releasez.webs.com">MDK Releasez</a></b> 
	website and from <b>
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ultrastar-base.com/">UltraStar Base</a></b>. 
	So today, I decided to upload the remaining 3 songs and post all 4 in here. 
	=)<br>
	So if you have UltraStar Deluxe, just head to the &quot;Music and Sound&quot; section 
	of the site where you'll find those 4 songs available for download, just 
	insert them in the &quot;Songs&quot; folder of USDX, open the prog, and sing! =D<br>
	Hope you all have been enjoying the SuperModel emulator! Don't forget to 
	visit the main site for the latest updates of the emulator!<br>
	Let's keep hoping that SEGA releases Daytona USA 2 for the home-consoles.<br>
	That's all for now!<br></div>

    @ Friday, 11 November 2011
    <br>
    <br>
    	Well, there's been some months since I last updated the website. I must appologize for that, the time at hand isn't much and the will to do it it's not that big. 
	So sorry. XD<br>
	<br>
	Anyways, here's some news that some of you have been eager to read around 
	here:<br>
	<b>A NEW MODEL 3 EMULATOR IS OUT! </b>Since April 1st of this year, a new 
	(old) emulator called <b>SUPERMODEL</b> appeared in the internet. And this 
	emulator, <b>emulates Sega Model 3 like NEVER BEFORE SEEN</b>. I inserted 
	(old) in there because in fact, this emulator exists since years ago, but at 
	the time, the project was cancelled. Some months ago, one of the authors of 
	the emulator decided to start work on it again, and there you have it. =)<br>
	<br>
	So head over to the <b>ROMs</b> section <b>NOW</b> and download the latest 
	version of the emulator from it's official website. be shure to read the 
	information on the section for some enlightning on how to run the emulator.<br>
	<br>
	Also, a <b>BIG SPECIAL THANKS</b> to <b>Scott</b> for sending me the e-mail 
	giving me the heads-up for this emulator.<br>
	<br>
	In other news, the Daytona USA 2 Battle on the Edge ROM has been 
	re-uploaded. The older one was a bad dump, and was replaced temporarily with 
	a fix. Now the correct GOOD DUMP of the ROM is available to download. Also, 
	don't forget the Power Edition version. =)<br>
	With this emulator, you can also play Scud Race, Sega Rally 2 and any other 
	Model 3 ROM.<br>
	<br>
	Heads-up! You'll need a very good graphics card and a very good CPU to run 
	this baby @ proper FPS. Also, the Xbox 360 USB Game Controller IS Supported. 
	=D<br>
	And Has SOUND!<br>
	<br>
	Oh Yes! I almost forgot. For those who have Xbox360 with XBLA or a PS3 with 
	PSN, can now obtain the Daytona USA original port of the model 2 game. =D I 
	have it, I love it! You REALLY must buy it! You won't regret it. It's a 
	perfect port of the Model 2 version of the game. Plus, it has extra content.<br>
	Now, we must wait for the Daytona USA 2 and Scud Race port. it's up to you, 
	SEGA...<br>
	<br>
	For now, that's all. I guess I won't be updating this up again for some time 
	now. And THIS was already a LATE update... Sorry again. If something new 
	comes up again, I'll update the website ASAP. But for now, see you again in 
	a couple of months. Stay cool!<br></div>

    <br>
    Finally, after years of searching the web and trying to compile the lyrics of the game myself, thanks to <b>Tempest</b>, I got a hold of the scans of the 
	<b>Daytona USA 2 Official Guide</b> and <b>Official Booklet</b> from the <b>Official Soundtrack.</b> =)<br>
	So now, the <b>lyrics section is complete</b> with the most correct lyrics for you 
	to enjoy.<br>
	New images have been inserted in the <b><a href="misc.html">Miscelaneous</a></b> section.<br>
	Also in the <b>Images</b> section, a few <b>ZIPs where added for download</b>. 
	A <b><a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediafire.com/?o9gqassxuceyu0y">ZIP Compilation</a></b> with all the <b>Flyers</b> of the game, the <b>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediafire.com/?vn1r8hdp8ouc810">Sega Official Books: Daytona USA 2 Official Guide Scans</a></b>, the

	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.mediafire.com/?he8lqpqmcmd808i">Saturn Magazine Interview Scans</a></b>.<br>
	The Original Soundtrack section was also slightly updated, where the links 
	for the booklet and new lyrics where added.<br>
	Two new links where added in the <b>Links</b> section, the <b>Contacts</b> 
	and <b>About</b> sections where also updated.<br>
	Special thanks to <b>Tempest</b> for this huge update. Check his homepage @

	That's all for now. Don't expect new updates in the next months. If not 
	everything, little is now missing here from the site. This site is the 
	BIGGEST Daytona USA 2 content available on the Internet. Enjoy.<br></div>

    @ Saturday, 14 August 2010
    <br>
    <br>
    This website is totally dedicated to the game Daytona USA 2,
    Battle On The Edge version and Power Edition version.<br />
    <br />
    <strong><font color="#FFFFFF">Bit of History...</font></strong><br />
    Back in the days of 1998, SEGA AM2 released <font
    color="red">Daytona USA 2: Battle On The Edge</font> in the
    arcades.<br />
    Using the powerful <font color="#8000ff">SEGA Model 3 Step
    2.1</font> arcade system, which was later on partially used in
    the development of the <font color="blue">Dreamcast</font>
    system, the game was a immediate hit, with the most advanced
    graphics of the time, incredible sound&nbsp;and superb
    playability. One of the new features this game has that the
    original Daytona USA doesn't&nbsp;is the ability to select a
    car, each with varying capabilities for varying levels of
    player experience.<br />
    <br />
    A&nbsp;few months after Battle on the Edge was
    released,&nbsp;SEGA released an upgraded version of the game,
    the <font color="red">Power Edition</font> version.&nbsp;This
    version&nbsp;features&nbsp;slightly revamped handling physics,
    changed A.I. system to make the enemy cars drive more
    aggressively, the environment of the beginner course was
    changed, leaving the layout of the track itself intact and a
    new mode was incorporated, the "<font
    color="#ff8000">Challenge</font>" course option, where you are
    able to play all the three courses linked together (Advanced
    -&gt; Expert -&gt; Beginner). Also,
    the&nbsp;beginner&nbsp;"<font color="#ff8000">Chum's
    Gum</font>" car was replaced with the "<font
    color="#ff8000">J.C. Eagle</font>" car, although the colors and
    performance remain the same. Another feature that was inserted
    in this version of the game, making a lot of fans very happy,
    was the inclusion of the "<font color="blue">Hornet</font>
    <font color="red">Classic</font>" car! The car from the
    original Daytona USA, with a slightly changed and upgraded
    design.<br />
    <strong>"Hornet Classic" is ONLY available in Power Edition,
    NOT in Battle on the Edge.</strong><br>
<br>
    Both versions of the game use
    advanced NASCAR-style drafting&nbsp;techniques, referred to by
    the game as the '<strong><font
    color="lime">slingshot</font></strong>' ability.<br></div>
