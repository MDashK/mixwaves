          First, let's get the basic principles of cornering.<br>
		This not only applies to all racing games, but also to real-life racing.<br>
			<br>
			<hr>
			<br>
			<b>Small Turning Angle</b><br>
			The best way to get a corner correctly passed is to drift with the smallest turning angle.<br>
			What does it mean? The car must be running with the most straight line.<br>
			With this, your car won't lose much speed, even during cornering, but also you'll get the best speed when finishing the curve.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Steer in Advance</b><br>
			When your car is going in a straight direction and you want to turn it left or right, you'll notice that the car doesn't change direction instantly.
			Instead, the car starts to gradually change direction.<br>
			This is because of the inertia that's being applied in the car's direction, forcing it to go straigth.<br>
			To be able to null this inertia and change the car direction almost instantly, you'll have to apply a counter-force.
			This is pure phisics, so while you're turning the car, only a portion of the turning force is used to stop the straight inertia.
			This results in a loss of time, since your car will only turn totally after going straight for some seconds.
			If you take these couple of seconds to steer before reaching the corner, you'll have a better angle when you actually enter the curve.
			This will benefict your cornering<br>
			<br>
			<b>Drifting</b><br>
			It's very rare to see someone drift a car around the city. Generally, people just turn the car by steering, adjusting the speed and braking.
			It's the safest method, but when you're racing, what you need is speed. A fast way to pass the corners without losing your position.
			In the diagram below, the green arrow indicates the <b>forward force</b> of the car. The blue arrow indicates the
			<b>centripetal force</b> when cornering, and the orange arrow is the result - the 
			<b>actual direction</b> that the car is going.
			As you can see, while drifting, the orange arrow is nearer to the direction that the car should go. When compared with a normal cornering, you can accelerate more when your car is drifting.
			This will give you greater speed when you come out of the curve. Also, you must note that a precise control of the steer and gas pedal is required to correctly achieve this.
			If you excess, the car will overturn and possibly hit the wall, the rail or simply start to spin and out of control.<br>

			Below are the continuous snapshots of a player performing a drift in the L-shaped corner of the Advanced track. Follow these as a guide and you'll know what to do when you need to drift.<br>

            <div class="text">Easy cornering doesn't mean that the corner can be passed by just 
            steering the wheel. Reducing speed is still needed or a little 
            drifting in order to pass through.<BR><BR>For easy 
            cornering, what you have to do is to <STRONG>relese the gas, turn 
            the wheel and brake together</STRONG>, and then release brake. 
            When the car starts to slide, step on the gas to let the car go 
            through the rest of the corner without spinning. Usually you 
            can go through these corners with a minimum speed of 290kph.<br>

            <div class="text">In this type of cornering, you'll have to steer earlier. Also, you may need to reduce speed before starting to steer.<br>
				<br>
								After the proper adjustments are made, brake and steer, and control the car while drifting.
			One point to mention is that, as you can see in the diagram, your car will not be facing straight forward, but facing the inner edge when coming out of the corner. This is called "oversteering".<br>
				<br>
								To prevent from crashing, you'll have to steer the car to the other side when you are nearly out of the corner. This technique is called "Counter Steering". 
			If you crashed on the outer wall with this action, reduce more speed when entering the curve.<br>
								Normally you can have a minimum speed of 245kph in these corners.<br><br></div>

            <div class="text">Finally, the ultimate challenge is here.<br>
				Hard cornering includes the hairpin curve in the advanced course, and the 360 degree curve in expert course.<br>
				They're sharp, long, and deadly.<br>
				<br>
				First of all, keep entering from the outer side, brake and steer in advance.  After the car slides in, you'll have to control the force stepping on the gas precisely. If in excess, your car will fly straight to the outer wall. In the reverse course, you'll hit the inner edge. Use your steering wheel to control the car slide with an angle of about 75 degrees from the moving direction. When near the corner outlet, gradually step the gas to bottom and steer back to prevent oversteering.<br>
				<br>
				<IMG src="img/cornering/cx3.jpg" style="border: 2px solid #99CCFF"><br>
				<br>
				For the hairpin in the advanced course, the corner is banked up on the outer side. As a result, you should keep on the outer edge to make use of this advantage. While in expert course, you should keep near the inner edge in order to "run the smallest circle" and gain advantage.<br><br></div>
