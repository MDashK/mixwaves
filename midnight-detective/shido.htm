Recently, he broke away from the vampire  Cain, who led Shido to  his current life. He  knows very little about his own past as Cain  took his memories away from him when he  transformed Shido into a vampire. Now Shido  works on unsolved crimes, helping those  who've unfortunately become involved with  the demonic creatures known as "the Breed."  His weapon of choice is a sword created from  his own blood. -->
