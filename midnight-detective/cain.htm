<!--CAIN The vampire who turned Shido into a vampire and stole his memories. He  is a beautiful yet cruel man who always seems to gets what he wants.   Cain always seems to appear to Shido from the shadows, eagerly  anticipating the birth of the                  "golden age."  He is constantly  looking for opportunities to                         bring his Shido back although  Shido has no intentions                                of returning to his side. -->
